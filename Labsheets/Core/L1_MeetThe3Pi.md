In this exercise sheet, you will get to know the **3Pi+ robot** that you will be using throughout these labs and for the coursework assessments. 


In this labsheet you will:

+ See the standard Arduino sketch, which has the structure of setup() and loop() routines.
+ Experiment with Arduino Example sketches.
+ Upload sketches to your 3Pi+ robot.
+ Experiment with Serial commands to view debug output from your code.


**If you have difficulty connecting to your 3Pi+, please see the notes Troubleshooting.**
