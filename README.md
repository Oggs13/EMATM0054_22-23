## Suggested Timeline

As a 20 Credit unit of study, you are expected to **invest 16 hours per week** to use the Core Labsheets to complete Assessment 1 Line Following Challenge.  For example, you could structure your time into two 8 hour days per week, or four 4 hour sessions of work.  **In general, it is recommended you focus for long blocks of time when learning to program a robot**.  It is likely you will fail Assessment 1 if you only work in the 2 hour laboratory sessions.  Use the laboratory sessions to discuss with the teaching staff problems and challenges that you have discovered during the week.

## Core Labsheets (Assessment 1)

It is recommended you read through all Labsheets before you start, and then decide on which areas you need to focus on.  If you have prior experience programming, there may be areas you can skip.

The first case of autonomous behaviour.  Debugging robot behaviours may be a challenge (e.g., "this isn't doing what I expected" might not be just a software problem). <br><a href="https://github.com/paulodowd/EMATM0054_22-23/blob/main/Labsheets/Core/L4_ExercisesOnly.md">(Link to Exercises Only)</a> |
